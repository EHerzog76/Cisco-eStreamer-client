# eStreamer eNcore
This is a fork of the Cisco eStreamer client.

The Cisco Event Streamer (also known as eStreamer) allows you to stream System intrusion,
discovery, and connection data from Firepower Management Center or managed device (also
referred to as the eStreamer server) to external client applications (e.g.: Syslog, Elasticsearch, Azure Sentinel, ...).

eStreamer responds to client requests with terse, compact, binary encoded messages â€“ this
keeps it fast.

eNcore is a new all-purpose client which requests all possible events from eStreamer, parses
the binary content and outputs events in various formats to support other SIEMs.
